# Jarga Marketing Site Plan

## Mission
**"Make working in teams simple!"**

---

## Core Values

- **Context is king** - you cannot deliver excellent outcomes without agreeing ground truth
- **Context switching kills productivity** - you shouldn't need five different tools when in flow
- **Information should be beautiful and simple** - complexity kills creativity
- **Effortless collaboration is how we win** - it shouldn't be hard to work apart
- **Teams only function well when information is easy to find** - knowledge rework is a major issue
- **We always make it easy to join and easy to leave** - no proprietary lock-ins
- **Different people work differently** - make the system work in different ways (keyboard shortcuts vs mouse)
- **Meet people where they are** - minimal disruption to flow, at all touch points
